<P>
Please do not put any stock into what I believe, as most of it is autocontradictory and the rest contradicts itself.

<UL>
	<LI><B>Affirmative action</B> - very necessary. As it is, it's flawed, but it's sure as hell better than nothing at all. If you have serious problems with it you might be part of the reason it's needed.</LI>
	<LI><B>Baloney</B> - spelled "baloney".</LI>
	<LI><B><I>Call of Duty</I></B> - propaganda with which I don't agree.</LI>
	<LI><B>Capitalism</B> - ridiculous.</LI><UL>
		<LI>Why should a corporation get to siphon off profits from my work?</LI>
		<LI>Why should people be able to make money without laboring?</LI>
<!--		<LI><I>and in its current implementations...</I></LI><UL>
			<LI>
Why were <A HREF="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx">
	one in every ten households food-insecure in the USA</A> in 2019, despite the fact that <A HREF="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/food-loss-and-waste">
	30 to 40% of the food supply goes to waste</A>?
			</LI> Not enough relevance to topic.
			</UL> -->
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Cereal</B></LI><UL>
		<LI>The milk goes after the cereal into the bowl.</LI>
		<LI>Corn flakes aren't that bad, despite their origins.</LI>
		<LI>Cereal with coffee instead of milk is pretty good.</LI>
		<LI>Soggy cereal beats out freshly poured cereal most of the time. Exceptions are maybe Cocoa Pebbles and Cheerios. Life cereal is especially good soggy.</LI>
		<LI>The last powdery bits of the cereal are much better than the initial big bits. A lot of that powder is sugar and it sweetens the milk.</LI>
		<LI>Bag cereal is just as good as box cereal. Taste-wise they're identical and they're about the same effort to pour because the boxes have bags in them too. The only con to bagged is that a greater amount of cereals are boxed (e.g. there are no off-brand Wheaties where I am) and boxes have cool puzzles on the back (though now that I'm not a wee lass I do have a cellphone on which I play Konami Picross instead).
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Children</B> - I generally agree with <A HREF="http://harmful.cat-v.org/society/children/">Cat-v.ORG's stance</A>, though maybe to a lesser extent.</LI>
	<LI><B>Computers</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Document editor</B> - I like Wordpad on Windows even despite the fact that it's proprietary. Sue me. I like Libreoffice elsewhere.</LI>
		<LI><B>GNU plus Linux</B> - No. I use the plan9ports utilities (which is a dangerous game but one from which I can recover with my backup hard drive and a couple commands), does that make my OS a plan9+Linux system?</LI>
		<LI><B>Jargon</B></LI><UL>
			<LI><B>/bin</B> - pronounced bin
				<BR />Why? "bine", as in <B>bin</B>ary, sounds stupid. I think of it as a bin in which to place binaries.</LI>
			<LI><B>/etc</B> - pronounced etsy
				<BR />Why? It's easier to say than ee tee see or et cetera, and the literal meaning of the phrase is less important when it comes to describing file paths.</LI>
			<LI><B>/lib</B> - pronounced lib (like in "liberty")
				<BR />Why? See "bin", except I have no word imagery for its use.</LI>
			<LI><B>/mnt</B> - pronounced em en tee
				<BR />Why? It doesn't seem standard on Linux and a user with which I'm speaking may already have a "/mount" - <I>I</I> did when I was young and thought /mnt was reserved.</LI>
			<LI><B>/opt</B> - pronounced opt (like in "opt-in")
				<BR />Why? The user is <B>opt</B>ing in to <B>opt</B>ional software.</LI>
			<LI><B>/proc</B> - pronounced prock
				<BR />Why? Seems easier to say than "pross" like in <B>proc</B>esses.</LI>
			<LI><B>/selinux</B> - pronounced ess ee linux
				<BR />Why? That's what seems intuitive to me. My system doesn't have it.</LI>
			<LI><B>sudo</B> - pronounced soo doo
				<BR />Why? It stands for <B>s</B>ubstitute <B>u</B>ser <B>do</B>.</LI>
			<LI><B>/sys</B> - pronounced sis
				<BR />Why? It's easy to say and short for <B>sys</B>tem.</LI>
			<LI><B>/tmp</B> - pronounced temp
				<BR />Why? It's where <B>temp</B>orary files go.</LI>
			<LI><B>vi</B> - pronounced vee eye
				<BR />Why? That seems to be what everybody says. Personally sometimes I say "vee" instead.</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI><B>Operating system</B> - I like anything POSIX or UNIX-like, nearly always Linux. Windows is unuseable for me.</LI>
		<LI><B>Text editor</B>: ne or vim (or vi). Notepad on Windows.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Florida</B> - should be swallowed by the sea.</LI>
	<LI><B>Necroposting</B> - good actually. If I have the same problem as another forum poster I want the previous knowledge gleaned in the same thread. It also makes it easier to reference in the future.</LI>
	<LI><B>Propaganda</B> - I used to make some. It's good when I agree with it.</LI>
	<LI><B>Standardization</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Date format</B> - YYYY-MM-DD. Anything else is a hate crime against people with brains.</LI>
		<LI><B>Time format</B> - T[HH]:[MM].</LI>
		<LI>Nobody will get on board with this but maybe we could mark dates from the Unix epoch? Just a thought.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>USA political parties</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>The Democratic Party of America</B> - sucks because they're Capitalist.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Green Party of America</B> - seems nice but the <A HREF="/shitlist#greenparty">behavior of the Georgian Green Party</A> deeply concerns me.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Libertarian Party of America</B> - I like it because it amuses me but it sucks because it's Capitalist.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Nazi Party of America</B> - it brings me slight relief that because this party was dissolved in 1983 most of its former members are probably dead.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Republican Party of America</B> - sucks because they're Capitalist.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Wrongspeak and wrongthink</B></LI><UL>
		<LI>If you're unaffected by a slur you probably shouldn't use it, even in an educational or non-hateful context.</LI>
		<LI>There are some words I'd now consider hateful I used to use without reserve.</LI>
		<LI>
Personally I don't use hateful language because I don't think it's justifiable.
However, if you're okay with offending people, consider this - you cannot grow in your understanding of the world if you don't communicate with people with whom you disagree.
You're really going to prioritize hateful speech over self development?
		</LI>
		<LI>If you go on my platform and say things with which I disagree, I should not have to host your opinions.</LI>
