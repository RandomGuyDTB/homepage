Please do not put any stock into what I believe, as most of it is autocontradictory and the rest contradicts itself.

	<LI>Cereal</LI><UL>
		<LI>The milk goes after the cereal into the bowl.</LI>
		<LI>Cereal with coffee instead of milk is pretty good.</LI>
		<LI>Soggy cereal beats out freshly poured cereal most of the time. Exceptions are maybe Cocoa Pebbles and Cheerios. Life cereal is especially good soggy.</LI>
		<LI>The last powdery bits of the cereal are much better than the initial big bits. A lot of that powder is sugar and it sweetens the milk.</LI>
		<LI>Bag cereal is just as good as box cereal. Taste-wise they're identical and they're about the same effort to pour because the boxes have bags in them too. The only con to bagged is that a greater amount of cereals are boxed (e.g. there are no off-brand Wheaties where I am) and boxes have cool puzzles on the back (though now that I'm not a wee lass I do have a cellphone on which I play Konami Picross instead).
		</UL>
	<LI>Computers</LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Document editor</B>: Wordpad on Windows, Libreoffice elsewhere.</LI>
		<LI>Jargon</LI><UL>
			<LI><B>/bin</B> - pronounced bin
				<BR />Why? "bine", as in <B>bin</B>ary, sounds stupid. I think of it as a bin in which to place binaries.</LI>
			<LI><B>/etc</B> - pronounced etsy
				<BR />Why? It's easier to say than ee tee see or et cetera, and the literal meaning of the phrase is less important when it comes to describing file paths.</LI>
			<LI><B>/lib</B> - pronounced lib (like in "liberty")
				<BR />Why? See "bin", except I have no word imagery for its use.</LI>
			<LI><B>/mnt</B> - pronounced em en tee
				<BR />Why? It doesn't seem standard on Linux and a user with which I'm speaking may already have a "/mount" - <I>I</I> did when I was young and thought /mnt was reserved.</LI>
			<LI><B>/opt</B> - pronounced opt (like in "opt-in")
				<BR />Why? The user is <B>opt</B>ing in to <B>opt</B>ional software.</LI>
			<LI><B>/proc</B> - pronounced prock
				<BR />Why? Seems easier to say than "pross" like in <B>proc</B>esses.</LI>
			<LI><B>/selinux</B> - pronounced ess ee linux
				<BR />Why? That's what seems intuitive to me. My system doesn't have it.</LI>
			<LI><B>sudo</B> - pronounced soo doo
				<BR />Why? It stands for <B>s</B>ubstitute <B>u</B>ser <B>do</B>.</LI>
			<LI><B>/sys</B> - pronounced sis
				<BR />Why? It's easy to say and short for <B>sys</B>tem.</LI>
			<LI><B>/tmp</B> - pronounced temp
				<BR />Why? It's where <B>temp</B>orary files go.</LI>
			<LI><B>vi</B> - pronounced vee eye
				<BR />Why? That seems to be what everybody says. Personally sometimes I say "vee" instead.</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI><B>Operating system</B>: Anything POSIX or UNIX-like, nearly always Linux. Windows is unuseable for me.</LI>
		<LI><B>Text editor</B>: ne or vim (or vi). Notepad on Windows.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI>Standardization</LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Date format</B>: YYYY-MM-DD. Anything else is a hate crime against people with brains.</LI>
		<LI><B>Time format</B>: THH:MM.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI>USA Leadership</LI><UL>
		<LI><B>The Democratic Party of America</B> - sucks because they're Capitalist.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Libertarian Party of America</B> - I like it because it amuses me but it sucks because it's Capitalist.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Nazi Party of America</B> - it brings me slight relief that because this party was dissolved in 1983 most of its former members are probably dead.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Republican Party of America</B> - sucks because they're Capitalist.</LI>
