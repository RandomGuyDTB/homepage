<UL>
	<LI><B>Affirmative action</B> - very necessary. As it is, it's flawed, but it's sure as hell better than nothing at all. If you have serious problems with it you might be part of the reason it's needed.</LI>
	<LI><B>Anarchism</B> - I don't understand it but it seems pretty cool.</LI>
	<LI><B>Baloney</B> - spelled "baloney".</LI>
	<LI><B>Bisexuality</B> - twice as cool.</LI>
	<LI><B><I>Call of Duty</I></B> - propaganda with which I don't agree.</LI>
	<LI><B>Cannibalism</B> - if it's consensual, sure.</LI>
	<LI><B>Capitalism</B> - ridiculous.</LI><UL>
		<LI>Why should a corporation get to siphon off profits from my work?</LI>
		<LI>Why should people be able to make money without laboring?</LI>
<!--		<LI><I>and in its current implementations...</I></LI><UL>
			<LI>
Why were <A HREF="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx">
	one in every ten households food-insecure in the USA</A> in 2019, despite the fact that <A HREF="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/food-loss-and-waste">
	30 to 40% of the food supply goes to waste</A>?
			</LI> Not enough relevance to topic.

		</UL>
	<LI><B>Cereal</B></LI><UL>
		<LI>The milk goes after the cereal into the bowl.</LI>
		<LI>Corn flakes aren't that bad, despite their origins.</LI>
		<LI>Cereal with coffee instead of milk is pretty good.</LI>
		<LI>Soggy cereal beats out freshly poured cereal most of the time. Exceptions are maybe Cocoa Pebbles and Cheerios. Life cereal is especially good soggy.</LI>
		<LI>The last powdery bits of the cereal are much better than the initial big bits. A lot of that powder is sugar and it sweetens the milk.</LI>
		<LI>Bag cereal is just as good as box cereal. Taste-wise they're identical and they're about the same effort to pour because the boxes have bags in them too. The only con to bagged is that a greater amount of cereals are boxed (e.g. there are no off-brand Wheaties where I am) and boxes have cool puzzles on the back (though now that I'm not a wee lass I do have a cellphone on which I play Konami Picross instead).
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Children</B> - I generally agree with <A HREF="http://harmful.cat-v.org/society/children/">Cat-v.ORG's stance</A>, though maybe to a lesser extent.</LI>
	<LI><B>Computers</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Document editor</B> - I like Wordpad on Windows even despite the fact that it's proprietary. Sue me. I like Libreoffice elsewhere.</LI>
		<LI><B>Free software</B> - most excellent.</LI>
		<LI><B>GNU plus Linux</B> - No. I use the plan9ports utilities (which is a dangerous game but one from which I can recover with my backup hard drive and a couple commands), does that make my OS a plan9+Linux system?</LI>
		<LI><B>Jargon</B></LI><UL>
			<LI><B>/bin</B> - pronounced bin
				<BR />Why? "bine", as in <B>bin</B>ary, sounds stupid. I think of it as a bin in which to place binaries.</LI>
			<LI><B>/etc</B> - pronounced etsy
				<BR />Why? It's easier to say than ee tee see or et cetera, and the literal meaning of the phrase is less important when it comes to describing file paths.</LI>
			<LI><B>/lib</B> - pronounced lib (like in "liberty")
				<BR />Why? See "bin", except I have no word imagery for its use.</LI>
			<LI><B>/mnt</B> - pronounced em en tee
				<BR />Why? It doesn't seem standard on Linux and a user with which I'm speaking may already have a "/mount" - <I>I</I> did when I was young and thought /mnt was reserved.</LI>
			<LI><B>/opt</B> - pronounced opt (like in "opt-in")
				<BR />Why? The user is <B>opt</B>ing in to <B>opt</B>ional software.</LI>
			<LI><B>/proc</B> - pronounced prock
				<BR />Why? Seems easier to say than "pross" like in <B>proc</B>esses.</LI>
			<LI><B>/selinux</B> - pronounced ess ee linux
				<BR />Why? That's what seems intuitive.</LI>
			<LI><B>sudo</B> - pronounced soo doo
				<BR />Why? It stands for <B>s</B>ubstitute <B>u</B>ser <B>do</B>.</LI>
			<LI><B>/sys</B> - pronounced sis
				<BR />Why? It's easy to say and short for <B>sys</B>tem.</LI>
			<LI><B>/tmp</B> - pronounced temp
				<BR />Why? It's where <B>temp</B>orary files go.</LI>
			<LI><B>vi</B> - pronounced vee eye
				<BR />Why? That seems to be what everybody says. Personally sometimes I say "vee" instead.</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI><B><CODE>main</CODE> as the default git branch</B></LI><UL>
			<LI>If you're a black person whose ancestors were freed from the shackles of slavery a couple generations ago, you shouldn't still be pushing your work to master.</LI>
			<LI>I want my projects accessible to anyone who may want to work on them.</LI>
			<LI><CODE>main</CODE> is easier to type than <CODE>master</CODE>.</LI>
			</UL>
		<LI><B>Operating system</B> - I like anything POSIX or UNIX-like, nearly always Linux. Windows is unuseable for me.</LI>
		<LI><B>Text editor</B>: ne or vim (or vi). Notepad on Windows.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Discrimination</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>on the basis of biology</B> - extra bad. You have to go way out of your way in order to discriminate against people based on genotype - you're <I>paying money</I> to test their DNA or whatever so you can discriminate against them. Weak.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of economic wealth</B> - discrimination against the rich is very cool and sexy, discrimination against the poor is gross.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of ethnicity</B> - bad.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of gender</B> - bad.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of nationality</B> - bad.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of race</B> - bad.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of religious beliefs</B> - bad. All ideas should be subject to criticism, but <I>discrimination</I> implies undeserved misery is being inflicted, so no I don't think <I>discrimination</I> based on belief is acceptable in any context.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of religious practice</B> - bad. If all parties in the activity consent it's completely bueno.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of sex</B> - bad.</LI>
		<LI><B>on the basis of sexual preferences</B> - bad.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Execution</B> - all people deserve to live, except monarchs.</LI>
	<LI><B>Eugenics</B> - proof anyone can make up facts, cite them to barely-relevant research, and get millions of people to fall for it.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fascism</B> - short-sighted and inevitably doomed to failure. Awful rule under which to live.</LI>
	<LI><B>Florida</B> - should be swallowed by the sea.</LI>
	<LI><B>Furries</B> - I've been too harsh to them. Furries are cool.</LI>
	<LI><B>Gun control</B> - guns shouldn't be scapegoated so much in the USA. The issue with mass shootings in the country is an issue of mental health. However, given that, I still don't know what I think should be done about them.</LI>
	<LI><B>Homosexuality</B> - pretty cool.</LI>
	<LI><B>Incels</B> - funny in a sad sort of way. Like "Proud Boys" except their pent-up anger does lead to people getting hurt, which I don't like.
	<LI><B>Land, Nick</B> - seems like a nice person.</LI>
	<LI><B>Monarchy</B> - I'm in favor of public execution of all remaining monarchs.</LI>
	<LI><B>Necroposting</B> - good actually. If I have the same problem as another forum poster I want the previous knowledge gleaned in the same thread. It also makes it easier to reference in the future.</LI>
	<LI><B>Nonconformity</B> - pretty cool. I'm in support.</LI>
	<LI><B>Propaganda</B> - I used to make some. It's good when I agree with it.</LI>
	<LI><B>"Proud Boys"</B> - cowards, and pathetic ones at that. They should leave terrorism to incels.</LI>
	<LI><B>Sex</B> - unnecessary. I use arch btw</LI>
	<LI><B>Standardization</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Date format</B> - YYYY-MM-DD. Anything else is a hate crime against people with brains.</LI>
		<LI><B>Time format</B> - T[HH]:[MM].</LI>
		<LI>Nobody will get on board with this but maybe we could mark dates from the Unix epoch? Just a thought.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Unions</B> - very cool but I'd rather work a non-union job than be unemployed. And I'll say what I mean - I like unions but I'm too much of a wimp to put myself on the line for them.</LI>
	<LI><B>USA political parties</B></LI><UL>
		<LI><B>The Democratic Party of America</B> - sucks because they're Capitalist.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Green Party of America</B> - seems nice but the <A HREF="/shitlist#greenparty">behavior of the Georgian Green Party</A> deeply concerns me.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Libertarian Party of America</B> - I like it because it amuses me but it sucks because it's Capitalist.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Nazi Party of America</B> - it brings me slight relief that because this party was dissolved in 1983 most of its former members are probably dead.</LI>
		<LI><B>The Republican Party of America</B> - sucks because they're Capitalist.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Weezer</B> - great band.</LI><UL>
		<LI><B>Weezer (the blue album)</B> - <I>equally</I> as good as Pinkerton.</LI>
		<LI><B>Pinkerton</B> - very good.</LI>
		<LI><B>Weezer (the red album)</B> - if you don't like it, you can shove it.</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI><B>Wrongspeak and wrongthink</B></LI><UL>
		<LI>If you're unaffected by a slur you probably shouldn't use it, even in an educational or non-hateful context.</LI>
		<LI>There are some words I'd now consider hateful I used to use without reserve.</LI>
		<LI>
Personally I don't use hateful language because I don't think it's justifiable.
However, if you're okay with offending people, consider this - you cannot grow in your understanding of the world if you don't communicate with people with whom you disagree.
You're really going to prioritize hateful speech over self development?
		</LI>
		<LI>If you go on my platform and say things with which I disagree, I should not have to host your opinions.</LI>
