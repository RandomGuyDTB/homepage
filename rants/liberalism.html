If you are a Liberal and cannot handle being told you're wrong,
please <A href="http://www.nyan.cat/">click here</A>.
</P>
<P>
Also, I should say <B>I am 17 years old</B>.
The worst flames I've seen on-line have been towards Leftists, from Liberals.
Like, come on guys, give me a break.
No I'm not ever voting Democrat, but I'm also never voting Republican.
Yes, I know my opinions may change, but I am voicing my thoughts here.
This is in a <A href="/rants/">rants/</A> folder for a reason.
</P>
<P>
The United States of America - the country in which I unfortunately reside - has a Liberal political party known as the Democratic party.
Most people choose to vote for Democratic or Republican (the Republican party is a Conservative party) candidates here.
Many of my acquaintances, most of my family (though I no longer associate with most of my family), and some of my friends are Liberal Democrats.
Liberalism is considered by many to be a politically left-wing ideology, and <I>the alternative</I> to Conservatism, as if the two ideologies are the only two that exist.
</P>
<P>
<B>I am not a Liberal.</B> I despise Liberalism.
I consider myself to be a Leftist and more specifically a Communist but I'm not entirely sure where My Preferred System would end up.
Fortunately that isn't my job, I just get to complain about those for whom it is.
</P>
<P>
So what is Liberalism?
The <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">Wikipedia page for Liberalism</A>,
which I will take at its word because in my experience most Wikipedia editors are themselves Liberal,
says the following:
</P>
<P><CODE>
Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty, consent of the governed and equality before the law.[1][2][3]
Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles,
but they generally support free markets, free trade, limited government,
individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), capitalism, democracy,
secularism, gender equality, racial equality, internationalism, freedom of speech,
freedom of the press and freedom of religion.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10]
</CODE></P>
<P>That passage has a lot of citations so it's probably factually correct.</P>
<P>
That set of beliefs is very interesting.
Liberals - and my experience agrees - support Capitalism in its implementations,
yet they also support racial and gender equality
(and I end the list of equalities they support there;
I've met too many Liberals who <I>do not</I> support equal rights for homosexuals or gender nonconformists and trans-genders).
In my view it is impossible to achieve equality between the races or sexes within a Capitalist system.
Capitalism is itself a system of inequality, where Capitalists exploit the working class.
</P>
<P>
What victories have Liberals secured for minorities that haven't been tainted or forgone entirely by Capitalists?
The thirteenth amendment to the American Constitution banned slavery <B>except as punishment for a crime</B>.
We've now introduced "prisons", some built where slave plantations used to be,
that can provide contract workers to big businesses for pennies an hour, themselves run by companies that are
<A href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXW">on the stock market</A>.
We liberated women only to give them unfulfilling lives dependent on wages and to pay them less than their male counterparts for the same jobs.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many American Liberals, despite theoretically being for a smaller government,
support gun control, which not only disproportionately affects minorities* but is also deceitfully stupid.
Freedom must be defended by those it protects.
If we prohibit certain people (<B>who have not committed any crimes</B>) from owning certain firearms eventually that will come full circle.
</P>
<P>
I believe most Liberals are uneducated and would be Leftists if they understood Liberalism.
I also believe most "Leftists" as labelled by the media are Liberals - because why would you draw attention to those who oppose you?
And those who are educated but still Liberals either benefit from the system or were educated in the wrong things.
</P>
<P>
I don't know how to end this because it's just a rant.
Don't take me too seriously, those that do never fare well.
</P>
<P>
* A source I found for this is
<A href="http://gypsyedc.com/blog/how-gun-control-disproportionately-affects-minorities-/">here</A>
but it's most definitely biased in favor of gun ownership. A better source is
<A href="https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/456243-actually-gun-restrictions-will-target-the-black-community">here</A>
and it's much better but I figured I should put a little disclaimer here because many of my sources are probably similarly biased.
