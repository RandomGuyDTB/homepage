I'm writing some <A HREF="https://github.com/devenblake/utilities">utilities</A> for my system.
Mostly math-related right now but there's also a crack at <I>head</I>(1) and the usual <I>true</I>(1) and <I>false</I>(1).
I've been meaning to write an article or something on how to install my implementations of true/false.
I do believe they're better than the GNU versions though it didn't take much (they're literally just <CODE>int main(void){return </CODE><I><CODE>n</CODE></I><CODE>;}</CODE>).

I got a new phone, the Unihertz Titan.
It's a behemoth and 1.5cm thick. Totally worth the $350.
It's seen active use since 0500 today and now at 1400 it's still at 75% charge.
That's on 4G LTE, playing music off the SD card and surfing the web.
