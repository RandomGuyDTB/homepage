I finished Burger King orientation on Halloween and worked my first day last Friday the thirteenth.
I'm getting paid ~$90 tomorrow for a week-end of work (5hrs + 8hrs - 1/2hr break), which works out to like $8/hr.
Pretty good!
Though it takes an hour to walk there and I can't afford a car nor a bike,
so if you add in the four hours of walking back and forth from the two days it's less fortunate.
Oh well. Still better than it could be.
I'm saving up for a new phone because my iPhone SE (2016) is long in the tooth, the battery dies in two hours in the cold.
Not getting an iPhone again... pieces of shit don't even have headphone jacks. Plus <A HREF="/shitlist#apple">Apple's on my shitlist</A>.
Before that though I'll probably get some nice work boots.
My shoes are starting to have weird cheap shoe issues and it makes walking really hurt,
which is unfortunate because most days I spend at least two hours walking.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people offer me rides and stuff.
I really like walking, even if it's twenty degrees Fahrenheit out in the morning and thirty in the afternoon nowadays and my shoes are awful.
When I was a kid I couldn't go a mile without panting. Now I can walk to school without breaking a sweat, back home without feeling tired (except from the school day),
and walk all around town without taking a break. And if you saw the kinds of drivers I see as a pedestrian, you'd be scared pissless of getting a ride from one of The Motorists too.
