<H3 ID="htmlbeliefs"><A HREF="#htmlbeliefs">What makes good HTML</A></H3>
<H4>updated 2021-05-12</H4>
<P>
It's no secret that I type every character of my website, by hand, without any form of generation.
I brag about it a lot. It's my justification for calling other, ostensibly better websites garbage.
It also doubles as a bit of a running gag. The intention, partially, is to shock people.
Also a bit to inspire them. "All you need is a browser and a text editor." And the usual contrarianism.
Many of these qualities are considered bad and for good reasons - it's just needless. We've progressed past raw HTML-writing.
Modern computers can handle modern websites. And these are all not only good reasons but true.
</P>
<P>
However keep in mind that sometimes progress isn't good. (I <B><I>do not</I></B> mean social progress, which I support in most forms.)
Where has progress in the web taken us? <I>Commercial advertisements</I> in cyber-space? Web browsers running proprietary third party code?
Digitally restricted media being limited to playback within browsers? While yes, these are technological advancements, they're a
progression of Capitalism, not of humanity. They are a sign of the conquest of the web by the hands of the corporate world. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
So I don't write bare HTML to be contrary to other "web developers", though contrarianism is a welcome part of it.
I write bare HTML to encourage the usage of web browsers that prioritize privacy and tell anyone looking to make a buck through the web to sod off.
</P>
<P>Anyway, with the philosophical side out of the way, here's a list in arbitrary order of things I think make good HTML</P>
<UL>
	<LI>
No necessary JavaScript <I>at all</I>.
If your site isn't accessible with NoScript enabled it's totally useless.
If you provide a service via JavaScript, rewrite it in native code.
If you provide a service that's redundant to others' services, good on you.
There needs to be more software diversity even with technologies I don't necessarily like.
	</LI>
	<LI>
Your site should be viewable without CSS.
It doesn't need to look pretty, it needs to be viewable and useable.
	</LI>
	<LI>
No <CODE>DIV</CODE>s or <CODE>SPAN</CODE>s.
If you're following the rest of these rules they're totally unnecessary.
	</LI>
	<LI>
No minification of any site code ever. If your site takes a long time to load you need multiple pages or less bloat.
	</LI>

<P>
This site uses Cloudflare for DNS but shouldn't have any Cloudflare tracking or anything like that.
There's no proxying. Nor do I (currently) log visitor IP addresses - <I>this may change</I>.
I like knowing from where my visitors are. But I don't know if I'd ever really do something invasive like that.
</P><P>
The only cookie used in this site is to establish the user's preference when it comes to the site theme.
This can be set using the control panel on the site index and isn't set at all until "save theme settings" is clicked.
If you never save the settings there will be no cookies on this site.
But if there are there's nothing I can do about that unless I borked the JS.
</P><P>
trinity.moe is served through GitHub Pages as a static site.
You see the same code I do. No JavaScript is minified or obfuscated.
You're free to plaigarize, pilfer, copy, whatever of this website you'd like, just don't put my name on something I didn't say.
Seriously. The code is yours. Take all the JS without crediting me. Hotlink the CSS. It's yours. You're free.
