    <H1>HELLO WORLD</H1>
    I'm Deven Blake.
    <MARQUEE><BLINK><H2>THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF MY HTML SKILLS</H2></BLINK></MARQUEE>
    seriously, this website is terrible. the \<MARQUEE\> tag isn't even ada-compliant and chrome won't display the \<BLINK\> tag either. this is just an example of wacky 90s html shiz
