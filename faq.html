<H4>Are you religious?</H4>
<P>The only god I worship is Hatsune Miku.</P>

<H4>What are your political beliefs? What do you think about [<I>thing</I>]?</H4>
<P>
See <A HREF="/politics">my political opinions</A>.
</P>

<H4>I messaged you on [<I>platform</I>] and you didn't respond. Why is that?</H4>
<P>
I'm not active on many platforms and the ones on which I am active tend to glitch out because I always have weird device setups.
If you need to get in touch with me I highly encourage you to contact me via SMTP at the addresses on the site index.
Unless you opened with something really weird, had I seen your message, I would have responded.
</P>

<H4>What genitals have you?</H4>
<P>I understand neither why one would ask this question nor why they would expect an answer.</P>

<H4>What's your sexuality?</H4>
<P>I'm not currently interested in forming a new romantic relationship.</P>

<H4>Why "Trinity"? Don't you go by Deven?</H4>
<P>I go by both. What do you think the T in DTB stood for?</P>

<H4>How do you pronounce "Deven"?</H4>
<P>
It depends.
I have the katakana translation of my name on the site index.
This says my name is pronounced "DEH vin", which isn't really correct.
It's actually "DEH vehn", which is distinct from the name "Devin".
In practice you're probably better off just saying "DEH vin", which is what I do.
</P>
<P><SMALL>
No, my parents did not curse me with some ungodly unique name; I got it changed (legally) from what it once was long ago.
Send guesses as to my birth-name on a postcard: <I><CODE>1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVE; WASHINGTON, DC 20500</CODE></I>.
</SMALL><P>

<H4>How do you pronounce "Trinity"?</H4>
<P>
You leetspeek "tr1n17y". Alternatively you may use the English approximate pronunciation "Trihnihtee".
</P>

<H4>How do you pronounce "Blake"?</H4>
<P>
"BLAYK".
</P>

<H4>Did you coin [<I>term</I>]?</H4>
<P>
I have said maybe once or twice that I made up the discretion between "disc" and "disk"
(that "disc" is for optical and physically impressive media, such as compact discs or phonograph discs, and that "disk" is for magnetic media, such as floppy disks or hard disks; there are however exceptions and edge cases).
That was an exaggeration.
Someone probably came up with that one before me. I just followed what seemed to me to be an implied convention.
</P>
<P>
I might have coined the term <I>catfella</I> (a synonym of the conventional <I>nyanbinary</I> on 2020-08-11.
Or someone else might have coined it first.
I can't find it used in the same context elsewhere on-line (I used it when referring to my friend Socks) but maybe we'll never know.
</P>
<P>
There are "Devenisms" (and you can conjugate that however you'd like with "Trinity" if you so choose),
which is what I call spontaneous and novel reformations and compoundings of previously-existing words,
but they're more Seussian than actual terms. I choose words based on how they taste, not how they look.
</P>

<H4>Are you {antisemitic,homophobic,racist,sexist,transphobic,xenophobic}?</H4>
<P>
Not intentionally.
This one tends to be rhetorical, and from people who believe otherwise.
You're welcome to browse my (no doubt terrible) political opinions, which are previously hyperlinked on this page.
</P>
