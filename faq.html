<H4>Are you religious?</H4>
<P>The only god I worship is Hatsune Miku.</P>

<H4>I messaged you on [<I>platform</I>] and you didn't respond. Why is that?</H4>
<P>
I'm not active on many platforms and the ones on which I am active tend to glitch out because I always have weird device setups.
If you need to get in touch with me I highly encourage you to contact me via SMTP at the addresses on the site index.
Unless you opened with something really weird, had I seen your message, I would have responded.
</P>

<H4>What genitals have you?</H4>
<P>I understand neither why one would ask this question nor why they would expect an answer.</P>

<H4>What's your sexuality?</H4>
<P>I'm not currently interested in forming a new romantic relationship.</P>
