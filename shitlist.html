<H1>deven's "shitlist"</H1>
<H3>updated 2020-11-15</H3>
<HR size="1" width="25%" align="left" />
<P>
This is my "shitlist", or list of things I don't like (with links to why I don't like them.
This is a list of <B>public figures and brands</B>, nothing personal.
If you're on this list you're probably famous enough to not have to care.
</P>
<P>
I would like to mention that the omission of a brand or figure on this list does not make them good.
"Good brands", in my experience, are just brands about which less is known.
I am also a human and therefore biased.
You're welcome to suggest additions to this list via a pull request on this website's git repository,
information about this can be found on the site index.
Or just email me.
</P>
