<HR size="1" width="25%" align="left" />
<P>
This is my "shitlist", or list of things you shouldn't like (- I like some of these things but probably shouldn't).
This is a list of <B>public figures and brands</B>, nothing personal.
If you're on this list you're probably famous enough to not have to care.
</P>
<P>
I would like to mention that the omission of a brand or figure on this list does not make them good.
For instance, Donald Trump is not yet on this list because of the sheer quantity of terrible things he's done.
"Good brands", in my experience, are just brands about which less is known.
I am also a human and therefore biased.
</P>
<P>
Any company that currently employs me will not appear on this list, and if I am employed by a company, they'll be removed.
</P>
<P>
You're welcome to suggest additions to this list via a pull request on this website's git repository,
information about this can be found on the site index.
Or just email me.
</P>
<P>I sourced many links from the personal page of Richard Stallman (who, ironically, <A HREF="#stallman">is also on this list</A>).</P>
<P>I'd also like to thank my friend Yarah for her contributions to this page.</P>
<P CLASS="opinion">
There are parts of this list that contain commentary of my own (rather than contextualization), those parts are gray and have the CSS class "opinion" - in uBlock Origin the rule to remove these bits is <CODE>##.opinion</CODE>.
</P>
