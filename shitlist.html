<P>
This is my "shitlist", or list of things you shouldn't like (- I like some of these things but probably shouldn't).
This is a list of <B>public figures and brands</B>, nothing personal.
If you're on this list you're probably famous enough to not have to care.

<P>
I would like to mention that the omission of a brand or figure on this list does not make them good.
For instance, Donald Trump is not yet well-covered on this list because of the sheer quantity of terrible things he's done.
"Good brands", in my experience, are just brands about which less is known.
I am also a human and therefore biased.
</P>
<P>
Any company that currently employs me will not appear on this list, and if I am employed by a company, they'll be removed.
</P>
<P>
You're welcome to suggest additions to this list via a pull request on this website's git repository,
information about this can be found on the site index.
Or just email me.
</P>
<P CLASS="opinion">
There are parts of this list that contain commentary of my own (rather than contextualization), those parts are gray and have the CSS class "opinion" - in uBlock Origin the rule to remove these bits is <CODE>##.opinion</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Finally, I'm human and I make mistakes curating this list.
Removed entries listed with explanations as to why they were removed.
</P>
<P>
I do this to jog my own memory, not to make money.
Please redirect any donations to <A HREF="https://archive.org/donate/">The Internet Archive</A>.
Without their Wayback Machine this list would be impossible to compile.

CDPR's game <I>Cyberpunk 2077</I> was pretty trans-phobic but it seems to me that a lot of outlets wrote about it just to have a story on a page and not to actually deliver information.
