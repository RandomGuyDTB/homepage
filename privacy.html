This site uses Cloudflare for DNS but shouldn't have any Cloudflare tracking or anything like that.
There's no proxying. Nor do I (currently) log visitor IP addresses - <I>this may change</I>.
I like knowing from where my visitors are. But I don't know if I'd ever really do something invasive like that.

<P>
The only cookie used in this site is to establish the user's preference when it comes to the site theme.
This can be set using the control panel on the site index and isn't set at all until "save theme settings" is clicked.
If you never save the settings there will be no cookies on this site.
But if there are there's nothing I can do about that unless I borked the JS.

trinity.moe is served through GitHub Pages as a static site.
You see the same code I do. No JavaScript is minified or obfuscated.
You're free to plaigarize, pilfer, copy, whatever of this website you'd like, just don't put my name on something I didn't say.
Seriously. The code is yours. Take all the JS without crediting me. Hotlink the CSS. It's yours. You're free.
