		<h1>My opinions on text editing</h1>
		<h3>updated 2020/04/17, proofread 2020/05/26</h3>
		<hr size="1" width="25%" align="left" />
		<p>I write prose/poetry in Rich Text Files (RTF) and everything else in plaintext.</p>
		<p>When it comes to RTF editing, I normally use Microsoft Wordpad on Windows and (prefer it to using) Libreoffice on everything else. I like RTF because editors handle everything for me - changing the font and indentations and everything is very easy - and because despite its proprietary-ness it's well supported and converts to plaintext relatively easily.</p>
		<p>When it comes to code, I only use Linux/UNIX/something with a console. I've tried coding in IDEs many times and every time I've been disappointed. I'm not used to using my mouse when I code and even when I acclimate I still don't like it. Lately I've been writing C and Python (I'm writing this HTML document on Windows 7's Notepad but I don't consider HTML to be "real" code) and when I write both I use "ne", the Nice Editor. It's simple and it uses a lot of common keyboard shortcuts. I avoid (but don't prohibit myself from) lines of code longer than 80 characters. I use tabs for indentation and I use a tab length of 3. I never use hard word wraps on plaintext if I can catch it and I don't normally use soft word-wrapping in code. I grew up on Microsoft DOS's EDIT.COM and it's still my go-to editor on DOS.</p>
		<p>My preferred encoding is UTF-8. I don't have a particular reason why, it's just a common standard. I disagree with emoji's inclusion in Unicode (and *especially* disagree with <i>how</i> the emoji being added). ASCII will always hold a place in my heart (and a chart will always hold a place on my wall) but I write enough Japanese to rarely use it. (This document is (probably) in ASCII.)</p>
		<p>I like Emacs for its use of Lisp (which I think is very fun to work in) and I respect Vim but think it's a little weird. When I use stock systems I use nano until I install ne. I'm not yet sure how to use ed.</p>
		<p>These are just my opinions if anyone's wondering, none of which I'm particularly passionate about. Edit how you want, produce what you want.</p>
