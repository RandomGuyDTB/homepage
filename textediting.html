<H1>My opinions on text editing</H1>

<p>I write prose in Rich Text Files (RTF) and everything else in UNIX-formatted plaintext.</p>
<p>
When it comes to RTF editing, I normally use Microsoft Wordpad on Windows and (prefer it to using) Libreoffice on everything else.
I like RTF because editors handle everything for me - changing the font and indentations and everything is very easy - and because despite its proprietary-ness it's well supported and converts to plaintext relatively easily.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to code, I only use Linux/UNIX/something with a console. I've tried coding in IDEs many times and every time I've been disappointed.
I'm not used to using my mouse when I code and even when I acclimate I still don't like it, though I've never used ACME before and that might change my mind someday.
Lately I've been writing C and Python and when I write both I use "ne", the Nice Editor. It's simple and it uses a lot of common keyboard shortcuts.
I avoid lines of code longer than 79 characters, and I use tabs for indentation with a tab length of 8.
I never use hard word wraps on plaintext if I can catch it and I don't normally use soft word-wrapping in code.
I grew up on Microsoft DOS's EDIT.COM and it's still my go-to editor on DOS.
</p>
<p>My preferred encoding is UTF-8. I don't like Unicode because I disagree with how emoji are being added. I have an ASCII chart on my wall.</p>
<p>When I use stock systems I use nano until I install ne. I'm not yet sure how to use ed.</p>
