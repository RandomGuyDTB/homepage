	<h1>deven's unix stuff</h1>
	<p>
So you just installed a UNIX-based OS and you don't know how to use it -
you don't know <i>at all</i> how to use it. UNIX stuff is heavy at first!
A lot of people get discouraged. However, after a while anyone can use
UNIX-based operating systems. This guide will serve as both a tutorial
and reference for general UNIX-based OSes, with testing being done on
Debian Linux.
