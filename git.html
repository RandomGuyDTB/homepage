		<h1>My opinions on git stuff</h1>

A lot of the Web (or, at least, the web <i>I</i> follow, which is a bunch of
weirdos with fringe beliefs that affect almost nothing in the real world,
except for when they do, which nearly always ends horribly*) seems to be fussed
about GitHub's recent (as of now, though it was a long time coming) decision to
make the default git branch `main` rather than `master`. Do I agree with this
decision myself? Of course! A very nice person on the website
<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter.com</a> explained this to me in the
following way that made me finally understand it: If you're a black person
whose ancestors were freed from the shackles of slavery a couple generations
ago, you shouldn't still be pushing your work to master. And there are
counter-arguments to this too; <i>the git master doesn't represent a
master/slave relationship!</i>, <i>etymologically it doesn't make a whole lot
of sense!</i>. Yeah? It's just sensitivity, really. I'm going to make my main
git branches main because I want my projects to be accessible to all those that
want to help - and a part of this is accepting changes to common practice that
are made in good faith. Also because main is a better term anyway in my opinion
because it's more descriptive and because 4 characters are faster to type than
6.

"<i>Where does it end?</i>" is a question I hear a lot. I'm not the one to ask.
Our words have a greater meaning than we know. I'm sure in fifty years many of
my opinions will be "products of their time" - and good! They are. In the
nineteenth century the goal was to free the slaves (a goal not yet realized),
in the twentieth century the goal was to have equality between men and women
(not yet realized) of all colors (not yet realized). In the twenty first
century we're now (some more keenly than others) aware of the LGBT+ community,
being the community of those with non-standard identities and romantic/sexual
orientations, and the importance of protecting the rights its individuals have.
What's going to happen in the twenty second century? Who are we oppressing <i>
right now</i> - who am <i>I</i> oppressing right now? I don't know. Time will
tell if you listen for it.

This whole blag rant was much deeper than I intended for it to be, but I feel
comfortable with my opinion. If I'm wrong I'm wrong in areas in which I meant
well, and that's good enough.
