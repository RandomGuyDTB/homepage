This background is from
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97qLNXeAMQ">100 gecs' money machine music video</A>.
Freeze-frame around 20 seconds in and you can get the frame I used.
The <A HREF="https://archive.org/details/vlcsnap-2020-11-09-14h04m11s472">Krita project and dependent files</A> are available on the Internet Archive,
it should work perfectly as-is in Krita 4.4.1 and compatible versions.
The file was exported as a JPEG with (I believe) 25% quality.

This background is from <I>The End of Evangelion</I> (1997), at 1h26m47s.
The copy I have is at 1920x1080 and was downloaded from 4anime.to for Fair Use as protected by United States Law.
The Krita project and dependent files are available in the previously-linked Internet Archive page, and were edited using Krita 4.4.1.
The output file was exported as a JPEG with 25% quality (I remember this time).

I was surprised to get voted for this superlative, I would have preferred <I>best hair</I> (though I am very grateful).
