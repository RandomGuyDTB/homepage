		<h1>My top films of all time, in order of release (by year, then each year's movies are alphabetized)</h1>
		<h3>updated 2020-10-10</h3>

 		<hr size="1" width="25%" align="left">

		<h4>The Great Dictator (1940)</h4>
			<p>One of Charlie Chaplin's few speaking roles. His best.</p>
		<h4>Citizen Kane (1941)</h4>
			<p>Good but overrated.</p>
		<h4>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</h4>
			<p>Klaatu barada nikto.</p>
		<h4>ゴジラ ("gojira") (1954)</h4>
			<p>The classic!</p>
		<h4>Dr. Strangelove (1964)</h4>
			<p>If I were to make a "kin"list as the kids say (though, in the sense that I identify <i>with</i> the character rather than whatever frightening thing originated on Tumblr) Dr. Strangelove would be at the top of the list.</p>
		<h4>Midnight Cowboy (1969)</h4>
			<p>Dustin Hoffman's in it, also it's rated X by the MPAA.</p>
		<h4>A Clockwork Orange (1971)</h4>
			<p>Red flag movie but I like it for its grooviness.</p>
		<h4>A Boy and His Dog (1975)</h4>
			<p>Like Tremors but completely different.</p>
		<h4>Network (1976)</h4>
			<p>Fox News if it was run by Scientologists.</p>
		<h4>Taxi Driver (1976)</h4>
			<p>I love it but if someone told me it was their favorite movie I'd avoid them.</p>
		<h4>Halloween (1978)</h4>
			<p>A horror movie that treats the viewers with some respect.</h4>
		<h4>Blade Runner (1982)</h4>
			<p>Good punk movie.</p>
		<h4>Back to the Future (1985)</h4>
			<p>Some bits are weird but still a great movie.</p>
		<h4>Heathers (1988)</h4>
			<p>Accurate high school movie.</p>
		<h4>Back to the Future III (1990)</h4>
			<p>Fitting end. Most people don't like it. Those people are wrong.</p>
		<h4>American Psycho (1991)</h4>
			<p>Timeless.</p>
		<h4>Reservoir Dogs (1992)</h4>
			<p>Non-linear storytelling, popularized. Good heist movie and it doesn't even show the heist.</p>
		<h4>Pulp Fiction (1994)</h4>
			<p>Fun vibe.</p>
		<h4>Hackers (1995)</h4>
			<p>The classic. Gets too much hate. PowerPC is indeed the future.</p>
		<h4>The End of Evangelion (1997)</h4>
			<p>Bear with the beginning.</p>
		<h4>La Vita è Bella (1997)</h4>
			<p>Good comedy until halfway through. Definitely worthy of its accolades.</p>
		<h4>Buffalo 66 (1998)</h4>
			<p>One of the most underrated movies of all time. A bit much at some points. My grandparents didn't like it, but I did.</p>
		<h4>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)</h4>
			<p>Nevada, captured in one movie. Or at least, how I imagine it.</p>
		<h4>The Matrix (1999)</h4>
			<p>If you haven't seen it you may not be old enough for the whole world wide web thing.</p>
		<h4>Kill Bill (Vol. 1, 2003; Vol. 2, 2004)</h4>
			<p>A samurai western set in the early 2000s. Defined the decade. There is more perfect irony that it's played by someone named Uma (馬 (うま, "uma"), is Japanese for "horse" - samurai western, remember?). Maybe the movie was made for the actor (possible, considering Tarantino worked with Thurman on Pulp Fiction), maybe the actor was made for the movie. But I can't imagine Kill Bill being the same with any other star. The stylization is incredible and the fight scenes are well choreographed. There are so many things about this movie I love.</p>
		<h4>Borat (2006)</h4>
			<p>Funny but offensive.</p>
		<h4>No Country for Old Men (2007)</h4>
			<p>Music is used as a prop rather than a distraction.</p>
		<h4>Superbad (2007)</h4>
			<p>Accurate high school movie.</p>
		<h4>Inception (2010)</h4>
			<p>Good action movie that makes you think.</p>
		<h4>Django Unchained (2012)</h4>
			<p>The Birth of a Nation, if it was completely different and a million times better. Incredibly satisfying.</p>
		<h4>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</h4>
			<p>There are two types of 80s business-driven sociopaths. Jordan Belfort is one and Patrick Bateman is another. You can't take your eyes off either.</p>
		<h4>The Hateful Eight (2015)</h4>
			<p>I like it because racists die.</p>
		<h4>シンゴジラ ("shin gojira") (2016)</h4>
			<p>The best thing to happen in 2016.</p>
		<h4>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</h4>
			<p>Finally, a sequel made well after the original movie that's actually good. Watch it in high definition, the DVD doesn't capture the feeling as well. (I watched it in the theater myself but from what I've seen the Blu Ray does look nice).</p>
		<h4>Assassination Nation (2018)</h4>
			<p>Accurate high school movie.</p>
