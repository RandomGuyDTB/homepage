Sometimes I casually flash my B-Unit around or pretend to check the time on it just to let everyone know I have a subscription.

Other times I will go out of my way to send emails from the terminal just so others get a glance at my @bloomberg.net email address. I also have people send me stuff to the email if it's someone I haven't met before.

The Bloomberg Terminal is well worth it for these two perks. It's much better than paying for an @hey.com email address.
