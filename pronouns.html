<H1>My pronouns and my opinions on pronouns</H1>
<H3>updated 2020-12-14</H3>
<HR size="1" width="25%" align="left" />
<P>
My pronouns are <CODE>they/them</CODE>.
That means when referring to me you would (for example) say "<B>They</B> are Trinity."
I'm a singular person and choose to use they/them pronouns mostly for pedantic reasons;
my "gender" (assuming such a thing exists) is my business alone and I see no reason to involve the public in that.
Maybe if I become more comfortable with myself that will change.

<P>
This might come as a surprise to people.
Most people I know get my pronouns wrong.
Nobody really asked me...
I'm cool with reaping the privilege that comes with being (perceived as) a male and currently fill out government forms so though I'm not one.
<P>
In general when it comes to pronouns I really agree with
<A href="https://stallman.org/articles/genderless-pronouns.html">
	Richard Stallman's article on genderless pronouns in English
</A> as it
<A href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201015032310/https://stallman.org/articles/genderless-pronouns.html">
stands today</A>,
<I>except</I> when it comes to "they" violating English grammar.
I find "they" and "them" to fit very well into English when used as singular pronouns
and when I need to refer to a thing between individuals and groups of people I just use
the proper noun.
I, too, will respect plural people whether this plurality is due to internal or external causes,
and I also will respect "xenogendered pronouns" (being gendered pronouns that are outside of
the set of "traditional pronouns" that is I/you/we/he/she/they/etc) but please just let me use
they/them because I can barely remember names.
